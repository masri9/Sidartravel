Thought for 110 seconds
أولاً، الرسالة بالعربية. دعني أترجمها لفهمها بشكل صحيح.

The message is in Arabic, so let's translate it for better understanding.
It reads: "I want to create a landing page for a tourism and travel office to showcase through it first."
Translating the message

Corrected errors for clarity, ensuring the message aligns with user intent.

ملاحظات حول تصميم صفحة الهبوط المقترحة بناءً على الصورة

الشعار: يظهر في الأعلى بشكل واضح واحترافي، وهو مهم لجذب الانتباه وبناء الثقة.
رسالة ترحيبية مختصرة وواضحة: ترحب بالعملاء بعبارات ودودة مثل "مرحباً في سيدار ترافل"، وتعطي نبذة قصيرة عن الخدمات بجملة مقنعة.
استخدام الرموز (الأيقونات):
الأيقونات تمثل الخدمات بشكل بصري جذاب وسهل الفهم (eSIM، الطيران، الفنادق، الفيديو أو وسائل الإعلام).
جميع الأيقونات محاطة بأشكال عضوية ملونة تجعلها ملفتة للنظر وغير مملة.
التنسيق والألوان:
ألوان هادئة من الأزرق والبرتقالي تمنح إحساسًا بالراحة والثقة.
التدرجات اللونية تعطي إحساساً بالحركة والحداثة.
اقتراحات لتطبيق هذا التصميم في صفحة هبوط لمكتب سياحة وسفر

الشعار في الأعلى: حجم مناسب ووضع مركزي.
جملة ترحيبية:
استخدم نصًا مشابهًا لما في الصورة: "مرحباً في [اسم المكتب]" مع جملة قصيرة تشرح رؤية المكتب أو مزايا الخدمة.
خدمات المكتب بالأيقونات:
ضع 3-4 أيقونات تمثل خدماتكم (مثلا eSIM، حجوزات طيران، فنادق، أنشطة سياحية).
إضافة تأثير "التطفو" عند التمرير أو تثبيت الأيقونات في مكان وجعل

بالطبع، إليك وصف وتصميم مطابق لما في الصورة التي أرفقتها يمكنك استخدامه كصفحة هبوط لمكتب سياحة وسفر:

تصميم صفحة هبوط مشابهة:

1. شعار الشركة (SIDAR TRAVEL)
شعار ملون متدرج (برتقالي، أزرق، أخضر) مع شكل طائر يعبر عن حرية السفر.
نص "SIDAR TRAVEL" بخط واضح واحترافي بجانب الشعار.
2. بطاقة ترحيبية (مرحبا بك في سيدار تراڤل)
مربع بزاويا مستديرة بلون خلفية فاتح (تقريباً أبيض مع تدرج خفيف).
نص ترحيبي جاذب:
مرحباً بـ سيدار تراڤل
رمز كرة أرضية: "رحول سفر ذكية."
مزايا المقدمة:
طيارات – خدمة سريعة ودفع آمن.
رسالة مشجعة:
"وجهتك تبدأ – رحلات، اتصالات، اتصال وراحة بال!"
3. الرموز التعبيرية (الأيقونات) مع تأثيرات لاحقة
أيقونة لـ eSIM (رمز بطاقة SIM + نص eSIM) داخل شكل أزرق عضوي.
أيقونة طائرة داخل شكل برتقالي عضوي.
أيقونة لفندق (شجرة ونخلة ومبنى) داخل شكل أخضر أزرق.
أيقونة فيديو (الكلاكر) داخل شكل أخضر أزرق غامق.
4. الخلفية والألوان
تدرج ألوان خلفية هادئ بين الأزرق الفاتح والأصفر الفاتح يعطي شعوراً بالهدوء والاحترافية.
استخدام أشكال عضوية بألوان متباينة لجذب الانتباه للأيقونات.
5. استخدامات أخرى مقترحة
إضافة تأثير "الطفو" على الأيقونات (تحرك بسيط عند التمرير أو ثابت يلفت النظر).
إضافة زر CTA (دعوة لاتخاذ إجراء) أسفل الكرت الترحيبي: (احجز رحلتك الآن، تواصل معنا، الخ).
جعل الصفحة مناسبة للاستخدام عبر الهواتف المحمولة (Responsive Design).
إذا أردت، يمكنني مساعدتك بتقديم نسخة HTML وCSS مبسطة لهذا التصميم أو نموذج مرئي (Mockup) أيضاً. هل تود ذلك؟

ملخص صفحة الهبوط التي أرفقتها

اللغة والتنسيق:

الصفحة باللغة العربية، واتجاه النص من اليمين إلى اليسار (dir="rtl").
خطوط جميلة وسهلة القراءة (خط "Tajawal" من Google Fonts).
خلفية الصفحة:

تدرجات وأشكال لونية ناعمة وعصرية بألوان الشعار (الأزرق، البرتقالي، الأخضر، الأصفر) مع تأثيرات أمواج وفُقاعات متحركة خفيفة تضفي حيوية.
الشعار:

في الأعلى مركز وواضح، يحمل رمز طائر ملون بجانب نص اسم الشركة "SIDAR TRAVEL".
بطاقة الترحيب الرئيسية:

مستطيل أبيض شبه شفاف مع زوايا دائرية وتظليل ناعم.
نص ترحيبي كبير باللون الرئيسي مع رموز تعبيرية لجذب الانتباه.
وصف صغير يشرح باختصار خدمات السفر (eSIM، طيران، فنادق، سيارات، تصوير) مع تأكيد على السرعة والدفع الآمن.
جملة تحفيزية باللون الأزرق.
الأيقونات/الخدمات:

أربع "فقاعات" أو عناصر عضوية ملونة بألوان متدرجة تمثل الخدمات: eSIM، فنادق، طيران، تصوير.
كل فقاعة تحتوي على أيقونة بيضاء واضحة مع علامات نصية مختصرة تعبر عن الخدمة.
الأيقونات تتمايل بحركة انسيابية تُبرز تفاعل وتركيز على كل خدمة، ويظهر تأثير تكبير وتحريك عند المرور عليها بالفأرة (Hover).
روابط الاتصال / الأزرار:

أزرار تواصل واتساب وزر لاستعراض الخدمات في الكرت الترحيبي.
شريط خارجي عائم في الأسفل يحتوي على أزرار واتساب، اتصال، وزر استكشاف الخدمات.
تأثيرات وفلسفة التصميم:

استخدام حركة متناسقة وناعمة لجعل الصفحة أكثر حياة وجذباً.
الألوان متناسقة مع هوية الشركة.
التصميم بسيط لكن فخم واحترافي.
توصيات إذا تريد تعديل أو استخدام الكود:

قم بتعديل روابط الاتصال وأرقام الهواتف لتلائم مكتب السفر الخاص بك.
ضع شعار مكتبك الخاص مكان الصورة (رابط الصورة في الكود) إذا تختلف.
إذا تريد إضافة أو تقليل خدمات، يمكن تكرار أو حذف كتل .service-blob بسهولة.
اضف محتوى إضافي أو أزرار مخصصة حسب الحاجة.
هل تريد مساعدة في تنفيذ هذا الكود على موقعك مباشرة أو إضافة ميزات إضافية مثل نماذج حجز أو خرائط؟


اريد نعيير شكل الايقونات تخت البطاقة وجعل البطاقة الترحيبية شفافة قليلا

بالطبع! لتعديل الكود لديك ليتناسب مع الشكل الذي في الصورة:

1. جعل البطاقة الترحيبية شفافة قليلاً:
في كود CSS الخاص بالبطاقة .welcome.pro غيّر الخصائص التالية:

css
6 lines
Copy code
Download code
Click to expand
.welcome.pro {
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85); /* بدل اللون الأبيض المتدرج بـ شفافية */
...
2. تغيير شكل الأيقونات تحت البطاقة إلى أشكال عضوية أكثر انسيابية:
قم بتعديل .service-blob وأشكالها لتصبح أشبه بالفقاعات العضوية في الصورة.

استبدل الخصائص border-radius بأشكال ناعمة جداً مع منحنيات مختلفة لكل فقاعة:

css
36 lines
Copy code
Download code
Click to expand
.blob-esim {
background: linear-gradient(145deg, #4DA8F7, #2A70DC);
...
3. تعديل حجم الأيقونات بداخل كل فقاعة لتكون أكبر وتتماشى مع الشكل:
css
17 lines
Copy code
Download code
Click to expand
.service-blob .icon-wrap {
width: 60px;
...
4. نص البطاقة:
يمكنك تعديل حجم الخط والمحاذاة لتكون مشابهة:

css
20 lines
Copy code
Download code
Click to expand
.welcome.pro h1 {
font-size: 28px;
...
إذا تريد، أستطيع تجهيز لك نسخة الكود المعدلة بالكامل جاهزة للتجربة، فقط أخبرني!


عدل كل الكود

شرح التعديلات:
الخلفية أصبحت ألوان تدرج ناعمة مع ألوان قريبة لصورة الخلفية المرفقة (أزرق سماوي، أخضر فاتح، بيج هادئ).
البطاقة الترحيبية شفافة قليلاً (rgba(255 255 255 / 0.88)) مع تأثير تمويه (blur) وخلفية واضحة جداً بزوايا دائرية كبيرة (36px).
نص البطاقة خط أكبر وأوضح، اللون أزرق غامق مع الرموز التعبيرية كما بالصورة، مع تباعد مناسب ومقروئية جيدة.
أيقونات الخدمات مستويات الألوان، الأشكال العضوية (blob shapes) مع تحرك بسيط بنظرة مرنة بحركات عائمة (floatSoft) تعطي نفس الانطباع المرئي.
حجم الأيقونات والنصوص داخل كل فقاعة أكبر قليلاً لتتناسب مع شكل الصورة.
تم إضافة وصف بديل وتهيئة لسهولة الوصول (accessibility) بحيث تستخدم العناوين واستخدام aria-label للتعريف.
يمكنك تحميل الملف وتجربته مباشرة، وإن احتجت أي تعديل إضافي — أنا هنا للمساعدة!
